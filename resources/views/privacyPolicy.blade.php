                <p>Open Access BPO is committed to the privacy and protection of personal information provided by all employees who are using our internal platforms. We have updated our Privacy Policy to make it easier for you to understand what information we collect and why we collect them.</p>

                <p>We are making these updates as new data protection regulations come to effect in the European Union, and we’re taking the opportunity to make improvements for our users.</p><br/><br/>

                <h4 class="text-primary">When we act as Controller and Processor</h4>

                <p>Open Access BPO will be acting as the “Controller” of the personal data you provide directly to us via employee survey forms, when redeeming employee rewards such as electronic vouchers, or through other employee engagement methods. </p>

                <p>If you are an employee providing personal details in order to avail products and/or services from our third-party vendors, we will be acting as the “Processor” of your personal data. Our third-party vendor will be acting as Controller of your information. As Processor, we do not own, control, or direct the use of any data provided to us by you.</p><br/><br/>


                <h4 class="text-primary">What we collect</h4>

                <p>At this time, only information directly provided by the users are collected; personally identifiable information such as external email address, phone number, and other information contained in our survey forms for our employee engagement program.</p><br/><br/>
                  
                <p>  <strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br/>

                 “Personally Identifiable Information” (or “PII”) refers to contact information that directly or indirectly tells specifically who you are, such as your name, phone number, company name, job, email, postal address, or any other information that could be linked to you with reasonable effort. We do not collect sensitive information such as location information (GPS), racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and genetic data.<br/><br/>

                  <strong>Passively or automatically collected data</strong><br/><br/>

                  Passively or automatically collected data (referred to as “Usage Data”) is collected as you use this platform. We may use automated means to collect various types of information about you, your computer or other device used to access this site, and its services. This information is based on your usage of this platform and your activities within EMS. <br/><br/></p>
                  <br/><br/>

                  
                  <h4 class="text-primary">Why we collect it</h4> 

                  <p>The information you shared shall be used for employee engagement purposes. We ensure that all information will be kept confidential, secured, and will not be sold to any third party organization.<br/><br/>

                  In the event that we do share information, expect that we will secure permission first from the Data Subject, unless sharing these details are prerequisites for the availment of third-party products and/or services, or had been required by law or by Court Order.<br/><br/></p>

                 <h4 class="text-primary">Why we need your data</h4>

                  <p>We need to know the PII you provide to us directly in our capacity as Controller for purposes of sending out requested products and/or availment of services from our third-party vendors. In addition, we may use these data for further analysis and as basis of our upcoming employee engagement activities to boost the morale of our employees.<br/><br/></p>


                  <h4 class="text-primary">Where we store it</h4>

                  <p>Personal information collected through EMS platform shall be stored in a secured internal server being hosted within the Open Access BPO office. This server is maintained and secured, with regular diagnostics and backups performed by our IT team.<br/><br/>

                  
                  <strong>How long we keep your data</strong><br/><br/>

                  We will not retain your PII for longer than required. This means that we will keep your PII for any or a combination of time periods described as follows: (i) for as long as required by law, (ii) until we no longer have a valid reason for keeping it, (iii) until you request us to stop using it, or (iv) for so long as our customer for which you are an authorized user remains a customer.<br/><br/>

                  When we delete your PII from our databases, it will remain in our backup system until it cycles out.<br/><br/>

                  <strong>Cookies and opt-out procedures</strong><br/><br/>

                  Open Access BPO EMS does not use cookies to automatically collect Usage Data. Cookies are small text files a website uses to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user’s ongoing access to the site, and facilitate the use of the site. Since EMS is an internal platform, all user activities are tied up to an employee account created by our Recruitment/HR team upon employee training and hiring.<br/><br/></p>

      
                  
                  <h4 class="text-primary">The Data Subject’s rights</h4>

                  <p>If you still feel unsecured after reading our privacy policy, any personal information collected may be accessed, updated, or modified by the Human Resource team, and we will only require a written request.<br/><br/>

                  Users may contact our HR team via email: employee_relations@openaccessbpo.com<br/><br/></p><br/>


                  <h4 class="text-primary">Your rights</h4>

                  <p> 

                  

                  You may contact us to find out if we are processing your PII. If we are, you can ask us what personally identifiable information of yours we hold and what we do with your data. If you would like, we can also provide you (or, where technically feasible, your chosen third party) with a copy of any PII that we hold about you, subject to a fee specified by law (not to exceed the reproduction cost of such document).<br/><br/>

                  We may decline a request for access to or correction of PII in circumstances prescribed by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Australia), and if we do, we will provide you with a written notice that sets out the reasons for the refusal (unless it would be unreasonable to provide those reasons) and the mechanisms available to you to make a complaint.<br/><br/>

                  In addition, you may: (i) request access to and rectification or erasure of your PII, (ii) request restriction of processing your PII, and (iii) withdraw your consent at any time. If you provide a notice to us regarding your exercise any of the above rights, we will forward your notice to other authorized parties which are holding and processing your PII, where appropriate.<br/><br/>

                  
                  <strong>Privacy notice shield for users in the European Union</strong><br/><br/>


                  Open Access BPO complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. Open Access BPO has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield, Open Access BPO is potentially liable. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

                  International transfer<br/><br/>

                  If you are from outside the US, understand that you are sending PII and Usage Data to the United States where our servers are located. That information may be then transferred within the US or back out of the US to other countries outside of your country of residence. Except for the US and our certification for the Privacy Shield, these countries many not necessarily have data protection laws as comprehensive or protective as those in your country of residence; however, our collection, storage, and use of your PII and Usage Data will at all times be governed by this Privacy Policy.<br/><br/>

                  
                  <strong>Compliance with data privacy and protection laws</strong><br/><br/>

                  This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for purposes of compliance with data privacy and protection laws.<br/><br/>

                  

                  <strong>Inquiries and Complaints</strong><br/><br/>

                  If you have any inquiries or complaints about our use of your PII, please let us know. You can contact our Employee Relations team, and we will take reasonable steps to investigate the complaint and respond to you.<br/><br/>
