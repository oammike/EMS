Through this valuable toolkit we can coach, guide, set goals for, and make thrive our most valuable resources --- our talents, our people.<br/><br/>

                    Please be informed that our cut-off for Apr.08 payout is Apr 05, 2021. Employee's DTR should be approved and locked in EMS <strong class="text-danger"> on or before TUESDAY 10:00AM of April 06, 2021</strong>.<br/><br/>

                    In case that your rest day falls on the cut-off and has no access in EMS, please ensure to inform your immediate supervisor to lock your DTR on your behalf.<br/><br/>

                    If you have any payroll-related inquiries and concerns, please log in to our Payroll Help Desk by clicking this link <a href="http://ticketing.openaccess.bpo/" target="_blank">http://ticketing.openaccess.bpo/</a>. You may also access it via EMS. For those employees who are working from home, your VPN should be connected before you can access the Payroll Help Desk.

                       <span style="font-size: 3em" class="text-primary">DTRP</span> is an acronym of <strong> Daily Time Record Problem</strong> which refers to the issues encountered that affect an employee’s timesheet or daily time record.<br/><br/>

                        <strong class="text-success">Connectivity Issues –</strong> these refer to electrical or power source issues, internet connection issues, power outage, and VPN connection issues.<br/><br/>

                         

                        <strong class="text-success">System Issues –</strong> these refer to issues encountered in our timekeeping tools like biometric device, Bundy.ph, and EMS<br/><br/>

                         

                        <strong class="text-success">Negligence/ Human Error – </strong>it pertains to personal exigencies, personal oversight, unintentional error<br/><br/>

                         

                        <strong class="text-success">Other Reasons –</strong> these refer to other issues not falling under the above 3 categories (e.g. business exigencies, new hire employee, technical issues)<br/><br/><br/><br/>

                         

                         

                        <strong class="text-danger"> What to do?</strong><br/><br/>

                         

                        <strong class="text-success">DTRP Due to Connectivity Issues –</strong> The employee should inform his supervisor about any ongoing connectivity issue and provide supporting documents for validation (e.g. service interruption announcement from ISP, internet speed check result, IT Ops – Service Ticket reference number, CCTV footage if onsite).  On the other note, Bundy can be accessed even without a VPN.  The employee may opt to not use it to avoid unnecessary DTRP filings due to VPN issues.<br/><br/>

                         

                        <strong class="text-success">DTRP Due to System issues – </strong>if Bundy.ph and EMS have any issues, the employee should provide screenshots from the company’s timekeeping tool. These are all subject for approval.<br/><br/>

                         

                        <strong class="text-success">DTRP Due to Negligence/ Human Error –</strong> Depending on the number of instances and the reason for such negligence, supervisors can request for Disciplinary Action or Incident Report to be issued to the affected employees. Supporting documents are required. For instances such as incorrect use of device (IN instead of OUT or vice-versa), logs not properly loaded to the system, etc., Data Management will immediately adjust and correct entries for the selected employee/s. If the issue was caused by negligence on the employee’s part, supervisors are advised to properly coach them to avoid repeated errors. Program tools that are approved by management can also be used as source for any missing logs.<br/><br/>


                        <strong class="text-success">DTRP Due to Other Reasons –</strong> Supervisors can seek assistance from the Data Management team to validate if there are indeed no logs or there was just an error occurred while uploading the logs to the system.<br/><br/>



                        The employee <strong>should send the screenshot</strong> of their secondary timekeeping validation tool to <strong class="text-primary">performancemanagement@openaccessbpo.com </strong> showing his login/ logout time in order for the DTRP filing to be approved.

                     <strong class="text-danger"> MYTH: Getting the COVID-19 vaccine means I can stop wearing my mask and taking coronavirus precautions.</strong><br/><br/>
                      FACT: Individuals who get the COVID-19 vaccination still need to practice infection prevention precautions. Keep your mask on, and continue staying at least 6 feet from people outside your household, until further notice. Vaccines do not stop the coronavirus from entering your body; they only prevent you from developing moderate to severe COVID-19. It’s not yet clear if people vaccinated for COVID-19 can still carry and transmit the virus, even when they themselves don’t get sick<br/><br/>


                      <strong class="text-danger">MYTH: The COVID-19 vaccine can affect women’s fertility.</strong><br/><br/>
                      FACT: The COVID-19 vaccine will not affect fertility. The truth is that the COVID-19 vaccine encourages the body to create copies of the spike protein found on the coronavirus’s surface. This “teaches” the body’s immune system to fight the virus that has that specific spike protein on it.<br/><br/>



                      <strong class="text-danger">MYTH: If I’ve already had COVID-19, I don’t need a vaccine.</strong><br/><br/>
                      FACT: People who have gotten sick with COVID-19 may still benefit from getting vaccinated. Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that re-infection with COVID-19 is possible, people may be advised to get a COVID-19 vaccine even if they have been sick with COVID-19 before.<br/><br/>

                      There is not enough information currently available to say if or for how long people are protected from getting COVID-19 after they have had it (natural immunity). Early evidence suggests natural immunity from COVID-19 may not last very long, but more studies are needed to better understand this. Several subjects in the Pfizer trial who were previously infected got vaccinated without ill effects. Some scientists believe the vaccine offers better protection for coronavirus than natural infection.<br/><br/>



                      <strong class="text-danger">MYTH: Getting the COVID-19 vaccine gives you COVID-19.</strong><br/><br/>
                      FACT: The vaccine for COVID-19 cannot and will not give you COVID-19. The two authorized mRNA vaccines instruct your cells to reproduce a protein that is part of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which helps your body recognize and fight the virus, if it comes along. The COVID-19 vaccine does not contain the SARS-Co-2 virus, so you cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccine. The protein that helps your immune system recognize and fight the virus does not cause infection of any sort.<br/><br/>

                      <strong><em>When overseas call-center employees have to work from home, neighborhood animals chime in; ‘the crowing was so close’</em></strong><br/><br/>

                      When Robin Frost called Verizon Communications Inc.’s customer support last month, she was connected with a rooster. At least that’s what it sounded like.<br/><br/>

                      The Pennsylvania resident wanted to ask about a problem with the telecom company’s app, but the agent on the line said she couldn’t hear. Punctuating her words was “the sound of a very authentic, real-sounding rooster,” Ms. Frost recalled.<br/><br/>

                      Thousands of call-center employees in the Philippines and India are working from home, often on the outskirts of urban areas or outside them, during their countries’ coronavirus lockdowns. That has given cows and pigs—but mainly roosters—a chance to chime in.<br/><br/>

                      “It was funny but not funny, and also maddening, as I couldn’t accomplish my task,” Ms. Frost said.<br/><br/>

                      Stefaan Smith, 36, who lives outside Phoenix, had a similar encounter when he called a Sprint helpline in March. He wanted to defer billing on his account after a pizza-parlor job fell through and left him with no money in the bank.<br/><br/>

                      “The crowing was so close,” he said of what sounded like an angry rooster, though that wasn’t the only animal present. “It was like right outside her window. You could hear her pigs grumbling and groaning.”<br/><br/>

                      After follow-up calls, he received a $50 credit from the provider, he said.<br/><br/>

                      Verizon didn’t respond to requests for comment. T-Mobile US, Inc., which owns Sprint Corp., declined to comment.<br/><br/>

                      Call-center executives say roosters are tough to silence. Americans often make customer-service calls in the late afternoon and evening, just when the sun is rising over countries like the Philippines and the birds are at their loudest. That’s when Junela Dumaya’s job gets tricky.<br/><br/>

                      <img src="storage/uploads/rooster2.jpg" width="98%" />

                      The 20-year-old works for Open Access BPO, a call center, and lives in a mountainous area a few hours’ drive from the Philippine capital, Manila. Her neighbor’s cow makes a racket in the mornings, as do her brother-in-law’s chickens.<br/><br/>

                      “I urge my family members to close the door and windows and to catch the cows and take the animals far from me,” said Ms. Dumaya, who begins her shift at midnight. Her family has been fairly effective, she said, though the animals still pose a distraction sometimes.<br/><br/>

                      Her boss, Ben Davidowitz, said he is doing his best to limit the animal soundtrack, adding: “I don’t want roosters honking in the background.” Sometimes employees are put up in housing close to work so they can go into the office, where small crews are permitted—and no roosters are near.<br/><br/>

                      <img src="storage/uploads/rooster3.jpg" style="padding:10px" width="30%" class="pull-left" />Bryce Maddock, the chief executive of TaskUs Inc., a customer-support outsourcing company, has dispatched noise-cancelling headsets. “I don’t think it’s rooster-proof, but that technology is at least one way to reduce the background noise,” said Mr. Maddock, whose firm has operations in the Philippines and caters to clients such as food-delivery services.<br/><br/>

                      Mr. Maddock has a history with roosters. He ordered a hit on one about a decade ago, when he was setting up his business in the Philippines. The neighbor of a staffer who was working from home had a noisy rooster that had become an operational hurdle.<br/><br/>

                      “We asked her how much we would have to pay to get the rooster killed,” he recalled. “She got a price from her neighbor and we paid the price and that was that. There was no more rooster in the background.”<br/><br/>

                      Mr. Maddock said he feels bad about it, particularly because he is now a vegetarian.<br/><br/>


                      Some say the rooster run-ins are providing comic relief. “At first, I was getting tired of hearing all the callers ask about the roosters, but nowadays we just laugh at it,” said Kathryn Ronquillo, a supervisor at a Manila call center that takes calls for a video-streaming company.<br/><br/>

                      A clip of a 2018 avian interruption, posted on Facebook by customer-service agent Jennifer Jasme, is getting fresh online traction in the Philippines. A man can be heard asking Ms. Jasme if she has chickens in her office, with cawing sounds audible in the background. Ms. Jasme responds that it’s actually a ringtone.<br/><br/>

                      “That was really funny,” Ms. Ronquillo said of the recording. “But we don’t want them to lie on their calls.”<br/><br/>

                      For agents like 36-year-old Ms. Jasme, it can be an awkward experience.<br/><br/>

                      “When I’m on a call and the roosters start to do their thing, like as if they are choir singing at the top of their lungs, I’ll start to pray and hope the customer won’t ask me my location,” Ms. Jasme said. Over time, she thinks it will become normal.<br/><br/>

                      “The world is changing, right?," she said. “I think we’ll get used to it.”<br/><br/>

                      Call centers aren’t the only businesses with rooster-induced headaches. Jimmy Roa runs an offshore recruit-process company in Manila whose agents conduct pre-qualifying interviews for job candidates for technology companies in America. When his employees dial out, their phone numbers show U.S. area codes, leaving the impression they are U.S.-based.<br/><br/>

                      “If a dog is barking, you can always apologize and say, ‘I’m sorry, my dog is right beside me,’ ” said Mr. Roa, chief executive of Sysgen RPO. “A rooster isn’t a normal pet in the U.S.”<br/><br/>

                      Because some customers feel being connected to someone halfway around the world means the company isn’t take their problem seriously enough, routing calls to Asia can be a touchy subject. Ms. Ronquillo, the supervisor, said a cock-a-doodle-doo signals to customers that they aren’t speaking to an American. While most callers are pleasant, she said, some ask to be transferred to a U.S. representative.<br/><br/>

                       <img src="storage/uploads/rooster4.jpg" style="padding:10px" width="30%" class="pull-left" />Others are uncomfortable broaching the rooster topic. Danielle Elizabeth, a 25-year-old retail manager in Pittsburgh, was charged twice for a home-delivered order of Chipotle’s veggie burrito bowl. When she called to resolve the matter, she heard what sounded like a rooster squawking.<br/><br/>

                      “I couldn’t get up the courage to ask, like, ‘Is there a rooster?’ ” she said.<br/><br/>

                      Ben Davidowitz’s company in the Philippines fields customer calls from employees’ homes; ‘we can’t have roosters in the background’<br/><br/>

                      Ben Davidowitz moved to the Philippines in 2010 to open call centers that allowed global companies to move their customer support services offshore. The coronavirus pandemic has forced the American entrepreneur to find a way for his workers to serve global customers from their crowded metro-Manila apartments.<br/><br/>

                      Mr. Davidowitz runs Open Access BPO, a company that counts a U.S. food-delivery service and a major hospital system among its customers. As clients manage the crisis, they rely on his Filipino staffers to field questions about insurance and delivery orders gone wrong.<br/><br/>

                      Two of his company’s largest call centers are based in the Philippines’ capital, Manila, which has been under lockdown since mid-March. While a skeleton crew works in the office, most of his 1,200 employees had to set up makeshift call centers at home.<br/><br/>

                      Open Access BPO’s revenue is down 12% since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, as some clients scaled back and terminated their contracts. And the new working procedures for employees come with additional costs.<br/><br/>

                      Many members of Mr. Davidowitz’s young workforce live in small apartments without desks or even internet connections. He dispatched technicians—carrying special passes from the government—to each of the homes where employees needed support. Over many days, the teams set up internet services, hauled work stations and tested the voice quality of calls.<br/><br/>

                      Answering customer queries, however, requires more than quality equipment. A quiet environment is also necessary.<br/><br/>

                      This is where Mr. Davidowitz faces a problem. Roosters are abundant in the areas a few hours’ drive from central Manila where many call-center workers live.<br/><br/>

                      “We can’t have roosters in the background,” Mr. Davidowitz said. “It may not be a rooster right at their house, but it could be a rooster next door. That immediately sends a red flag to a customer.”<br/><br/>

                      Around 200 of his employees continue to work from the offices because there isn’t enough space in their houses, internet connectivity is poor or the surroundings are too noisy from roosters or neighbors. They are seated far apart, and the company rented housing units and hotel rooms near the call centers for them to stay in. Food is provided for those working from the office.<br/><br/>

                      Once every two weeks, he drops in to his Manila call centers and makes sure employees are following social-distancing procedures.<br/><br/>

                      The complexity the 57-year-old faces in keeping the company’s phone lines open is compounded by increased responsibilities at home. He is now taking care of his 25-year old son, Harry Davidowitz, who has autism, full time because school is closed. Harry’s usual caretaker is staying home with family during the lockdown.<br/><br/>

                      These days, Harry wakes his father up at 6:30 a.m., hungry for breakfast or eager to listen to music. “He’ll just be standing there next to my bed like a statue, waiting for me,” Mr. Davidowitz said.<br/><br/>

                      Mr. Davidowitz said his son was “100% driven by routine” and that it was important to establish a new schedule to replace the old one. Harry, who is mostly nonverbal, still makes requests for his favorite foods and regular activities, such as going to the nearby swimming pool.<br/><br/>

                      “In a kid’s mind like his, the questions start flowing,” he said.<br/><br/>

                      With the pool closed, Mr. Davidowitz took an old bathtub he had in storage and hauled it up to his roof. He fills it with a hose so his son can splash around. “It’s turned into another activity we can incorporate into the day,” Mr. Davidowitz said.<br/><br/>

                      He also gives his son plenty of time to listen to his favorite electronic dance music and watch animation such as “Lilo & Stitch.”<br/><br/>

                      Mr. Davidowitz’s extended family has also been affected. Two of his brothers in Pennsylvania tested positive for Covid-19. One got better quickly, while the other battled the illness for weeks, with a fever, chills and night sweats, though has recently recovered.<br/><br/>

                      Mr. Davidowitz thought about flying home, but most commercial flights to and from the Philippines have been canceled. He also looked into chartering a private flight to see his brothers.<br/><br/>

                      He worried, though, that if he got sick, there would be no one to take care of Harry.<br/><br/>

                     Dear Open Access Family:<br/><br/>



                      I hope everyone is keeping safe and healthy. Although many of you are in isolation alone many of you are more fortunate to cherish the extra time we can spend with our loved ones.<br/><br/>



                      We are living through unprecedented times, a period in which 50 years from now people will look back as an important moment in history. It is hard to predict what will happen over the next few weeks and even few months. And while life is now testing each and every one of us, I am 100% confident we will all come through this stronger, if we stick together. Certainly many of us will have a new appreciation for life and the ones we love. <br/><br/>



                      Open Access has been through many ups and downs since 2006 - we started this business at the beginning of what was to become the Global Financial Crisis, an economic event that had not been seen since the Great Depression in the 1930s. This time is different as that period was just about money and jobs, something that can be replaced. COVID-19 is about something even more important - our health and our lives, which can't be replaced. <br/><br/>



                      As this situation is evolving, we are prepared to continue to do everything we can to ensure the safety of everyone at Open Access, as well as making sure everyone gets paid. While many companies in the U.S. are having to reduce their workforces, we are very fortunate the bulk of our portfolio of clients are stable and operational.<br/><br/>



                      In the last two weeks, we have shifted from an in-office BPO to a largely work-from-home operation only made possible by enormous efforts from our stellar IT team, Joy, and the rest of leadership. They have all worked tirelessly making this happen so quickly, which enabled us to continue to operate while Manila is locked down.<strong> Thank you!!!!!!!</strong><br/><br/>



                      Currently, we have approximately:<br/><br/>



                      - 800 people working from home <br/><br/>



                      - 170 people working out of all our Makati and Davao locations <br/><br/>



                      - 40 people working out of our Taiwan and China locations which are both fully operational <br/><br/>



                      We've been able to adapt to the situation that is a testament not only to our leadership but to all of you for making this possible. <br/><br/>



                      Your health and safety is of the utmost importance to me because the virus has also hit close to home. I now have two brothers who have tested positive for COVID-19. One has just recovered and one is still fighting at home, in quarantine, 8500 miles away in the U.S. It has been a sleepless couple weeks as I think about your health and safety as well as that of my brothers.   <br/><br/>



                      With Easter and Holy Week coming, many of you may think of compromising the current integrity of social isolation. You may want to see friends and family that you haven't seen for weeks now. I want you to all be vigilant in respecting our messaging to keep social isolation and have the least amount of contact with other people outside your household until it is absolute in the sense of your safety and others. The next two weeks are critical as we are expected to hit the peak of transmission in the Philippines.<br/><br/>



                      There is a ton of information floating around on the internet and I would like to emphasize one point which I hope puts things into perspective with the rest of this email:<br/><br/>



                      - The Philippines has tested 10,000 people with a population of 100MM<br/><br/>



                      - Germany is testing 500K people a week and has a population of 83MM<br/><br/>



                      I have advised Joy and our leadership there is no way the government can make an informed decision on the timing of the lockdown without the ability to test. Therefore, should the lockdown be lifted anytime this month we will continue with our current strategy of working skeleton crews in the office with most working from their home environments. <br/><br/>



                      I am very concerned the Philippines may make a premature decision heavily weighted by the economic climate. If the lockdown is lifted this month we will sit on the sidelines and observe if there are any new outbreaks and see if the cases are trending downward. A key deciding factor for me is when hospitals return to doing elective surgery - it means their capacity is no longer strained. Today, we are far from that.<br/><br/>



                      I also understand this situation is evolving daily so we will update you and communicate as much as we can via email and on the EMS. As stated above, your safety and making sure you are employed is our highest priority. <br/><br/>




                      One person I follow, who in my opinion knows more than any government about what is going on, is Bill Gates. I listen carefully to what he says. <br/><br/>



                      Below is a recent interview with Bill Gates. I encourage you to watch at your leisure…<br/>

                      Be Safe. Be Healthy. <br/><br/> 



                      Best,<br/>

                      The CoronaVirus Pandemic has caused exceptionally challenging and worrying time for each and every one of us. The effects of social distancing, lockdown, the loss of loved ones to the virus and the over-consumption of stress-inducing media reports is taking a huge toll on our mental health and wellbeing.<br/><br/>


                      According to,Nina Rifkind, LCSW, ACWS, who specializes in treating Anxiety Disorders and OCD, "Individuals who fight every day to manage symptoms, and those who love and support them, we can work to slowly turn the tide.  By sharing with people, we trust. And thoughtfully educating our family and friends, we can make those around us more sensitive, and aware, all year round, of the importance of how we all talk about mental health, and how critical it is to our health in general, mind, body and spirit."<br/><br/>

                      The OAMPI Clinic is also here if you need assistance in relation to Mental Health. Please do not hesitate to reach us. However, the government has provided us as well with hotline support in case you prefer to seek direct  professional help. <br/><br/>
                      Below are their numbers:<br/><br/>
                      National Center for Mental Health Crisis Hotline at <strong>0917-899-8727 (0917-899-USAP)</strong> and <strong>(02) 7-989-8727 ((02)-7-989-USAP)</strong><br/><br/></p>

                      We want to thank you for taking the time to take our Pulse Check 2020 survey and for sharing your feedback openly.  Your response has been valuable in helping us evaluate our work culture as well as our performance as a company for the first half of 2020. This shows us how we did at program and department levels, and helps us identify areas to improve and implement solutions for making your experience better.<br/><br/>

 

                      Your experience is important to assess because the more satisfied you are, the more of yourselves you'll invest in our company's mission and goals. High engagement often leads to better service and more efficiency in the workplace which, of course, leads to favorable business outcomes. If you are engaged, you are enthusiastic about your work and our company, and that enthusiasm rubs off on your team and customers, and on the Open Access culture as a whole. And that is important to all of us.<br/><br/>

                       

                      Here is a summary of what the data shows us, please see attached. Your leaders will be communicating with you soon to share program- and department-specific findings and action plans. Again thanks, team!

                    <strong class="text-primary"> UNCONSCIOUS BIAS</strong><br/>

                    Are you aware of your biases? Take the quiz to find out. <br/>
                    <a href="https://www.clocktimizer.com/clocktimizer-implicit-bias-test/" target="_blank">(https://www.clocktimizer.com/clocktimizer-implicit-bias-test/)</a><br/><br/>

                    The microlearning module: Unconscious Bias is available for a limited time in our LMS Catalog. All it takes is 20 minutes to:<br/><br/>

                    ·         Develop awareness of your own unconscious biases<br/>

                    ·         Overcome stereotypes and prejudice in the workplace<br/><br/>



                    <strong class="text-primary"> COMMUNICATING EFFECTIVELY</strong><br/>

                    How many times have your team members and/or coworkers misunderstood your message in the last three months? It’s frustrating when this happens. Not only do you have to repeat yourself, but you also lose precious time in the process, time you could have spent on doing something even more important and productive.<br/><br/>

                    Are you confident that you are communicating effectively? Learning how to communicate effectively is an essential skill for the workplace. Whether you’re working remotely or on-site – you can’t deny that you need to get your message across accurately.<br/><br/>

                    If you want to improve your communication skills, the microlearning module: Communicating Effectively is also available for a limited time in our LMS catalog. With a 30-minute seat time, here are the module objectives:<br/><br/>

                    ·         Build relationships with others by understanding how body language works<br/>

                    ·         Listen closely to others and ask questions that engage the other person<br/>

                    ·         Write professional emails that communicate ideas clearly<br/><br/>



                    <strong class="text-primary"> TIME MANAGEMENT</strong><br/>

                    That’s 50 minutes to learn about two topics. If you feel like you don’t have the time due to your workload, then we recommend you start your learning path with the module: Productivity & Time Management – also available in our LMS catalog.<br/><br/>

                    Here’s a quote from the module: “Time equals life. Therefore, waste your time and you waste your life, or master your time and master your life.” – Alan Lakein<br/><br/>

                    Our Information Security Awareness module is now live on our <a href="https://open-access.training-online.eu/" target="_blank"> LMS</a>! This is foundational to Open Access BPO strengthening system security and standardizing Information Security practices.  This is a <strong><a href="https://open-access.training-online.eu/" target="_blank"> required training</a></strong> and needs to be <strong>completed by August 27, 2020.</strong>
                    <br/><br/>

                    This is fielded once a year to ensure we’re all up to speed with the latest policies and protocols. This year, we are running it from July 27, 2020 to August 27, 2020. The knowledge check is short (15 questions) and would take only about 30 minutes or less to complete, and may be taken at any time which suits you during your shift. The number of days allocated for module completion is more than adequate, please finish it before the 30-day period expires.<br/><br/>

                      We've been on community quarantine for months now and we're hoping you've adjusted well to the new normal.<br/><br/>

                      Aside from staying indoors, staying healthy and active is also recommended these days! So how about we do it as one team?<br/><br/>

                      <strong>For onsite employees looking for a faster and equally safe everyday-transport option to the office:</strong><br/><br/>

                        If we were to launch an OA-accredited exclusive cab service, would you sign up if the rates were cheaper than Grab and the recurring weekly trips were scheduled for you?<br/><br/>



                        While our current shuttle service is free and has some degree of flexibility, ridesharing with longer lead times may not be for everyone. Before we can operationalize it, we need to find out if there was enough of you who’d want to use this exclusive cab service fleet for your daily office transport for a minimal fixed fare. If we get at least 20 positive responses, we will be able to set this up for you in about 2 weeks.<br/><br/>



                        Kindly answer the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="https://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/Z6bk4fu9HbL1novj6hfbIG" target="_blank"> survey here </a>. It will just take a few minutes.<br/><br/>

                        We will check the results up to <strong> July 12, 2020.</strong> <br/><br/><br/><br/>


                         



                        <strong class="text-success"> Here's how it will work:</strong><br/><br/>

                        To ensure health and safety when traveling to the office, we are planning to set up our very own OA Office Cab Service, a paid transport service from our private driver fleet providing daily prescheduled rides exclusive to OA employees who prefer to travel to work alone (or up to 1-2 carpool mates) and are willing to pay, making daily office trips faster and safer.<br/><br/>

                         

                        This is for those looking for an alternative to our current transport options: company shuttle service, private vehicle, or private carpool. Here then is another safe way for you to get to the office. Our Office Cab Service just might be for you. <br/><br/>

                      For those working onsite during GCQ, we will continue to provide a shuttle service. Now that there is more allowable movement, our goal is to get you here easily and more importantly, covid-free.  If you need to work in the office and need a daily ride to work, please complete this<a href="https://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/628acMekO89" target="_blank"> <strong>application form</strong></a>. This form is for both current and new shuttlers. <br/><br/>

                       

                      We are aware that although some forms of public transportation will now be available, it will be at reduced capacity and it won’t all be back 100%. We expect traffic and public transport to be grueling, problematic, and risky. We want to enable safe access for you so we will continue to provide free transportation during the general community quarantine period.<br/><br/>

                       

                      Please read and understand our terms and conditions of service in the OA Transport Policy, Procedures, and Guidelines before submitting the<a href="https://www.emailmeform.com/builder/form/628acMekO89" target="_blank"> <strong>GCQ Application Form</strong></a>. Make sure you send your request once you have official confirmation of your team returning to the office. Requests are subject to review and approval, and take at least 2 days to process. Once you receive a trip confirmation email, you will be reminded to submit the online Health Declaration Form (link attached in the notification email to be sent).<br/><br/>

                       

                      All shuttle riders will be required to have their COE and company IDs with them for checkpoints and follow our standard health measures and social distancing rules in our vehicles and in our offices. As the company has been doing all to keep us safe and operational, not sparing any expense, our marching orders are to be vigilant and responsible for our own safety at all times. <br/><br/>



                      Let’s be smart and super careful. Stay healthy!

                        This policy outlines the rules and procedures for drivers carpooling to work as part of our Company Shuttle Scheme for our skeletal workforce onsite during ECQ. This includes submission and payout procedures for reimbursement and incentive claims for office parking, toll fees, and carpooling. This is in response to the industry exemptions from suspended public transportation operations due to the Enhanced Community Quarantine for Luzon and in support of our employees who can drive to work during this period.

                    Due to the elevated ECQ restrictions, high volume of ride requests, and driver head count constraints, we have needed to streamline our trip planning to utilize our vehicle pool more efficiently and effectively. Please allow a ride-wait-time of <strong class="text-danger"> no less than 1 to 1.5 hours (even possibly 2-3 hours for farther vicinities)</strong> while you and your co-passengers get picked up.<br/><br/>
                    <strong>We request for your patience and adaptability for this time. We need to be able to accommodate everyone as mush as is within government ruling as well as our logistical capacity.</strong><br/><br/>
                    To be able to accommodate more shuttle riders, we have needed to schedule your shared rides in clusters of 1-3 hours ahead of your actual shift start time (possibly longer for those living in farther vicinities) and up to 1 hour from your shift end time. <br/><br/>
                    This was implemented April 3, 2020.  To reiterate, necessary adjustments in your pickup time have been made and communicated.  Please allot a longer time allowance. Kindly take note of your new ride schedules from the email notification that will be sent and prepare accordingly. 
                    Let’s all help each other get to and from work on time and safely.
                    Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

                     In Department Order No. 209 dated March 17, 2020, DOLE instituted the COVID-19 Adjustment Measures Program (“CAMP”) aimed at providing Financial Support to all affected workers. The DOLE likewise issued four (4) advisories which sought to clarify and supplement the CAMP guidelines and procedures.<br/><br/>

                      While awaiting DOLE’s FAQs on CAMP implementation, listed below are Q&As that might be of help:<br/><br/>

                      <strong class="text-orange">Q: How much is the DOLE’s financial assistance? </strong>

                      <span class="text-primary"> A: Php5,000. The amount is a one-time financial assistance to affected workers paid lump sum, non-conditional, regardless of employment status.<br/><br/></span>

                      <strong class="text-orange">Q: Who are entitled to the Php 5,000 financial assistance?</strong>

                      <span class="text-primary">A:  Only affected workers. Under DOLE D.O. 209 as supplemented by Labor Advisory 12-20, “affected workers” is defined as those whose employment suffer interruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic such as:<br/><br/></span><br/>

                      i)  Those whose regular wage is reduced due to implementation of flexible work arrangements; and<br/>

                      ii) Those whose employment is temporarily suspended by reason of suspension or closure of business operations.<br/><br/>

                      <strong class="text-orange">Q: Are those who work from home eligible to receive DOLE financial assistance?</strong>

                      <span class="text-primary">A: No. Under DOLE Memorandum COVID No. 01-2020, workers who still receive full wages (e.g. under telecommuting or work from home arrangement) are not entitled to the financial assistance.<br/><br/></span>

                      <strong class="text-orange">Q:  Can leave credits be utilized during the quarantine period?</strong>

                      <span class="text-primary">A: Yes. Under Labor Advisory No. 11-20, the leaves of absence during community quarantine period shall be charged against the workers’ existing leave credits, if any. Remaining unpaid leaves during said period may be covered and be subject to the conditions provided in the DOLE’s CAMP financial support program. Moreover, under DOLE D.O. No. 209, the financial assistance may be used to cover remaining unpaid leaves of affected workers.<br/><br/></span>

                      <strong class="text-orange">Q: Do I have the option not to use any of my leave credits?</strong>

                      <span class="text-primary">A: Apparently, yes. The DOLE Secretary announced in a press conference that employees have the discretion on whether to utilize his/her leave credits.<br/><br/></span>

                      <strong class="text-orange">Q: What is the process in availing the DOLE financial assistance?</strong>

                      <span class="text-primary">A: The Departments involved will initiate the process and apply with DOLE submitting the documentary requirements. The application for financial assistance is subject to approval of the Department of Labor and Employment.<br/><br/></span>

                      <strong class="text-orange">Q: When will DOLE release the Php5,000 financial assistance?</strong>

                      <span class="text-primary">A:  Once approved, the Php 5,000 will be paid by DOLE directly to your bank accounts at the soonest possible time.<br/><br/></span>

                    <strong class="text-primary">Deadline</strong> <br/>

                      Requests to change pick-up time should be submitted at least 24 hours before the schedule. <br/>

                      Same-day adjustment requests will no longer be accommodated. <br/> <br/>
 

                       <strong class="text-primary">Request Limit</strong> <br/>

                      To comply with the trip scheduling process and to encourage everyone to plan ahead, each shuttler will be allowed no more than 3* change-requests for the whole duration of ECQ. This will prevent disrupting preset driver and passenger trips. Once the limit has been reached no further requests will be processed.<br/> <br/>

                      * Reasons for pickup time changes due to CWS will require WFM validation.<br/> <br/>

                       

                       

                       <strong class="text-primary">Request Submission Procedure</strong><br/>

                      To avoid confusing multiple entries and unnecessary changes that disrupt trip scheduling and inconvenience other riders, if you are still within the request cap, please follow the steps enumerated below.<br/> <br/>


                      1.        Submit a Shuttle Application request at least 1-2 days before the set ride.<br/><br/>
                      <a class="btn btn-md btn-success" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScN8f9jalq2yUQJbOmw7cY2TYDV5TO5GFMEW9S3opZ7JD9wGQ/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-file-o"></i> Shuttle Application Form </a><br/><br/>

                      2.        Send an email to the Transport Team to itemize the schedule change details (follow the format below), including the link to the application form.<br/>

<pre>

Home-Pickup time change from:______To: _______

</pre><br/><br/>
                      3. Wait for a confirmation if the request is accommodated.<br/><br/>


                      <strong class="text-primary">Subject to Dispatch Review and Authorization</strong><br/>

                      Validated urgent same-day adjustment requests are SUBJECT TO REVIEW. <br/><br/>

                      If it is a WFM-approved CWS, attach its proof to your email request and complete the steps above.<br/><br/>

                       

                      As master trip lists for each day get set 2 days prior, any changes may potentially mess up the plotted queue of the driver routes and schedules.  Thus, they may not be accommodated or at the very least, take time to confirm and plug into the existing sequence. Please be prepared for the request to possibly either take time to be accommodated or be declined during high volume during peak hours.<br/><br/>


                      For your compliance and guidance.

                    Due to the high volume of ride requests, we need to streamline our trip planning to utilize our driver pool more efficiently and effectively.<br/><br/>

                    To be able to accommodate more shuttle riders, we would need to schedule shared rides in clusters of 2-3 hours ahead of your actual shift start time (possibly longer for those living in farther vicinities) and up to 1 hour from your shift end time. <br/><br/>

                    Effective immediately, please expect adjustments in your pickup time and allot a longer time allowance. Please take note of your new ride schedules from the email notification that will be sent, and prepare accordingly. <br/><br/>

                      For employees who are allowed to work from home ("WFH"), you are advised to continue working as scheduled.  To facilitate this WHF, we have assembled a deployment team who will help us enable work from home arrangements for programs whose clients have permitted us to do so. In this regard, kindly coordinate with your respective Immediate Heads and Managers.<br/><br/>

                      For the rest, please stay at home. Rest assured everyone will be fully paid for this week as Finance will automatically apply all accrued sick and vacation leaves. For those not entitled to any leaves yet or those who have no more leaves available, Finance will advance your leave credits which will be offset as you earn them.  <br/><br/>

                      To emphasize, the suspension of operations in merely temporary as we are aiming to work through the requirements in resuming operations onsite by next week to, at the very least, set up a skeletal workforce, for those that can and want to report back to work.  <br/><br/>

                      We encourage everyone to comply with the Government's directives in the hope that this community-quarantine is lifted sooner for us to be able to return to normal operations.
                    </p> <br /><br/>

                      <strong>Screening:</strong> <br/><br/><br/>

 

                      PRC Blood Services Facilities carefully screen potential donors. The screening guidelines are necessary to ensure that blood donation is safe for you and that it is safe for the person who will be receiving your blood.<br/><br/>



                      In the screening process, you have to fill out a blood donation questionnaire form that includes direct questions about behaviors known to carry a higher risk of blood-borne infections—infections that are transmitted through the blood. A trained physician will be asking you about your medical/ health history, and a physical examination will be conducted—which includes checking your blood pressure, pulse and temperature. All of the information from this evaluation is kept strictly confidential.<br/><br/>



                      During your blood donation screening procedure, a small sample of blood taken from a finger prick is used to check your hemoglobin level, the oxygen-carrying component of your blood. If your hemoglobin concentration is normal, and you've met all the other screening requirements, you can donate blood.<br/><br/>



                      Q: Can a person who has tattoo,piercing, currently taking medication and with travel history still donate blood?<br/>

                      A: Medication taken, travel history, tattoo and piercing to be assessed if qualified to donate.<br/>

                      <h5 class="text-primary"> Every volunteer donor will be given a BLOOD DONOR CARD during the event. This card may be used as a record of donation. However, this card does not exempt the holder from paying the processing fee. This is intended to cover the cost of the reagents an operating expenses used to collect and screen all donated blood for infectious disease</h5><br/><br/><br/><br/>

And as a member, she's taking her call for equal rights and free will and against injustices and discrimination to the streets in this year's Metro Manila Pride March: "We all want a happy ending. We resist for equal rights as heterosexual couples, such as recognizing our partner as our spouse, being able to adopt, being able to buy shared property in our names, and so on. <br/><br/>
                                We want discrimination to stop when we hold hands or kiss, apply for jobs, or enroll for education because of our gender orientation and the way we dress. LGBTQIA+ individuals are people who want to be accepted in society. We aren’t “sick” because our gender preference and identity. We are not different from you—we just have our own colorful individuality." <br/><br/>#WeSpeakYourLanguage #OASpeaksWithPride #WorldPride #PrideMonth2019

                                Being an active member of the LGBTQIA+ community,<a style="font-weight: bold;" href="./user/2070" target="_blank"> Quality Analyst Edwick </a>stresses the value of the people's call to #ResistTogether for HIV/AIDS awareness especially among the younger generation and to continue the fight against discrimination: "As an active HIV/AIDS awareness advocate, I share my knowledge on how to prevent the virus from spreading, so people can responsibly engage in activities that may put them at risk of getting infected. HIV/AIDS is one of the leading infectious diseases in the Philippines and some parts of the world, and I want to address the lack of knowledge among the people, most especially to the youth. <br/><br/>
                                Meanwhile, I am and will always be against the on-going discrimination against LGBTQIA+ individuals. Wherever we go, there will always be hypocrites who’ll trample us along the way. We continue to wait for the SOGIE (Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression) Equality Bill to be passed into a law, so that we can finally be at ease—hopefully." <br/><br/>

                              In light of the community's struggles, <a href="./user/1113" target="_blank">Customer Service Representative Anthony </a>is taking his stand with the community and allies to #ResistTogether for equality and against cruelty and exploitation: "I resist for equality. I believe that LGBTQIA+ rights are human rights, which we’ve been fighting for since the very beginning. We ask for the same freedom and respect, regardless of our gender preference and identity. We are not asking for your sympathy; what we need is understanding. For as long as we breathe the same air and inhabit the same lands, then we are all equal in this life.⁣ <br/><br/>

                              On the other hand, I resist against cruelty and exploitation. Every individual, especially young LGBTQIA+ persons, should be protected from any form of abuse. We all grow up exploring who we want to be, and it gets harder when you're growing up confused. So, they should be given more patience, nurturance, and love. I grew up in a very loving family. I’ve never felt alone because they support me in everything I do. I’d want every single person to have the same support that I got."⁣<br/><br/>

                        <p style="padding:10px 50px">Be grateful to what you have today and every little thing that will come your way— it’s one way to accomplish what you seek.<br/><br/>

                        Our fifth <strong>#WomenOfOA</strong> feature goes to one of Open Access BPO’s inspiring female leaders, <a href="{{action('UserController@show',1611)}}" target="_blank" > <strong>Emelda Perez</strong>, </a>(or Ms. E as everyone fondly calls her). In this feature, she talks about her belief system that she finds helpful in her role as an HR Director.<br/><br/>

                        "[I believe] what we learned from home can be applied wherever we are, especially at work. First, hard work in everything we do. With my role here at Open Access, I try to always give my best because I believe that’s how my staff learns from me. As they always say, to be a good leader you have to be a good follower also. Second is sincerity in how you treat people. It’s difficult to earn someone’s trust if you’re not sincere."<br/><br/>

                        "Third is flexibility, in terms of how I manage my time at work and at home. Whenever I’m needed at work, I focus and give my 100% attention. [Because] I know that like me, they too, have their own priorities and that their time is important. There are plenty of unexpected meetings, and so you need to learn how to manage your time; distinguish what’s important from urgent and vice versa. Focus and attention, so you can always give your best. The same thing goes for my family, I give them my undivided attention because that’s what they deserve. Time is important, no matter who you give it to."<br/><br/>

                        "Passion. I believe in passion for purpose. Because if you’re passionate in what you do, you can do great things. More so, having defined purpose allows us to understand what we’re capable of giving and whether we're capable of doing more."<br/><br/>

                        "Another thing is gratitude. You see, plenty of things do happen unexpectedly at work that may disappoint us. What do I do? I try to see the good in the bad. Oprah writes the things she’s thankful every day, and that helps her overcome the obstacles in her life. I do that also, and it helps me look ahead with positivity. Bad things happen, but they also end. We need to be positive in order to overcome the struggles we encounter in life. Of course, that includes our faith. Every day, before I go to work, I pray. Because I know I can do all things with Him. At the end of the day, I’m only human and I get tired and exhausted. What helps me keep up with life’s challenges? I surrender everything to God."
                        <br/><br/>
                        "Next, empathy. How we treat people describes who we [really] are. I believe that if you care for people, they’ll care for you as well. But if they don’t, then that’s okay. At least you sow, and you’ll never have to regret your actions. You can’t please everyone.<br/><br/>

                        Also, I admire people who stay grounded no matter what position or status they hold. That’s humility. Because whatever you do, you need to treat people with respect. Open Access is a multinational company. We have different people coming in the HR Department every day, these people have different beliefs, personalities, and preferences, and so we, [our team], make sure we exercise this value most."<br/><br/>

                        As she ends her answer, she adds, "The same goes here in the company, we have our own set of core values that we impart to the employees. That makes us work in harmony and at our best selves."<br/><br/>

                        "Values are things that we can apply anywhere, anytime. We apply them to influence good on others, so we don’t regret on whatever mark we may leave as we go forward. At the end of the day, what matters is that you don’t look back and say, 'Sayang!'"<br/><br/>

                        <p style="padding:10px 50px">Jimella is a hands-on mom, a full-time Content Writer, a loving wife, and a great friend. In spite of how overwhelming life can be and everything that comes with it, she manages to give her relationships with undivided attention and still leaves time for herself.<br/><br/>

                        For our fourth <strong>#WomenOfOA</strong> feature <a href="{{action('UserController@show',443)}}" target="_blank" > Jimella,</a> every woman can and here's the secret. "Personally, I just make sure to manage my time well so that I can tend to my family's needs. We don't have a helper so I'm pretty much a hands-on mom to my kids— I am their personal cook, teacher, nurse, hairdresser, and stylist. Every so often, we go on an out-of-town trip to let them explore and get in touch with nature. I think it's always a good idea to spend as much time with them because they grow up so fast! However, as much as I love my children, I also believe that every once in a while, my hubby and I deserve to have a date night [which we religiously follow]. Just a few hours of peace and quiet is enough to keep us sane." Along with being devoted to her family, she reminds women like her to have time for themselves as well. "Another important thing: it's essential to reward yourself a 'Me time.' Pamper yourself, go out with friends, or do things that you always want to try. Have a break from everything so that you can recharge and revitalize. That way, you can always offer a better version of yourself!" These can still be overwhelming for many, especially to those who are new to motherhood, but she believes every woman can bring something to the table to make it all work. "[For me,] every woman is a great multi-tasker. We have an extraordinary skill to juggle a lot of things but still can manage to accomplish greatly. We are loaded with responsibilities yet we always handle it with grace. No matter how challenging life gets, expect a woman to come out stronger!" #WeSpeakYourLanguage #OAonWomensHistoryMonth<br/><br/>

                          In our third feature, <strong>#WomenOfOA project</strong> presents <a href="{{action('UserController@show',90)}}" target="_blank" >  Lizelle Barboza:</a> an inspiring thrill-seeker who has the strength and determination to conquer trails. Her love for trekking through rough and treacherous terrains contributes a lot to who she is today.<br/><br/>

                          But we all know how daunting the road to success can be, and Lizelle has her fair share of similar experiences. "There is an event race that I joined with only few women participants [and] like them, I came prepared. However, I am aware that in an event race where you have to trek 6 mountains in 15 hours, the possibility of men winning is so much higher. So, I was just happy to finish the race." "Halfway the course, I almost felt like quitting because of the heat, jelly legs and exhaustion. I felt very weak, I pushed it a little at a time thinking not to waste my month-long training program for nothing. I took a stand and challenged myself to run pass every single runner as I can. This, eventually, helped me reach a pack of male runners [ahead]. That's when I realized I still have the energy to keep pace with them; that I can still push myself further to the finish line like them." She then recalled what kept her going to advance toward the finish line and complete the race, "Strength, focus, faith in myself and their encouragement— that's what I had at that moment that helped me believe I can make it too like the male runners, despite how tired and exhausted we were. We reached the finish line together and surprisingly, I completed the race as the 4th female runner!" What lesson did she learn from this experience? She happily shared, "Learning not to quit and having faith in my own strength are just some of the lessons I've learned from [trail running]. We all know women can do wonders like men and that nobody can stop us but ourselves. There's no superior nor inferior and no gender [bias] when it comes to keeping fit and leading an active lifestyle. Now, I am more confident of myself."<br/><br/>

                        <p style="padding:10px 50px">Maintaining a balanced life between one's career, family, and yourself can be challenging. But with the right mindset, it can be possible.<br/><br/>
                        

                        Today, we're putting the <strong>#WomenOfOA</strong> spotlight to our <a href="{{action('UserController@show',344)}}" target="_blank" >  Chief Financial Officer (CFO), <strong>Lisa Jackson-Machalski</strong></a>. 
                        Juggling her day to day responsibilities as a mother and as a career woman can make things challenging for her. But being the super woman that she is, she makes it a point to always give her best shot in all of the important aspects of her life— family, career, and herself. "My biggest struggle has been maintaining the balance between my personal and professional life. In order to compete and stay on top of the game, you need to be direct and assertive. It is often difficult to switch out of this mode when dealing with your partner and children. My daughter often told me growing up "You treat me like an employee." Fortunately now, she thanks me for that as she has become a very hardworking young woman with a great work ethic."<br/><br/> As she takes on another chapter in life, she shares, "Men are from Mars and women are from Venus does still ring very true when it comes to relationships. As progressive as you might think males can be, there is often that power struggle and competitiveness that you don't necessarily expect as it is often inherently wired in many males. My belief system, morals and ethics are more conservative in my personal life as I believe in a certain level of chivalry and males and females having pre-determined defined responsibilities. It can be very challenging to change out of your business woman persona into a wife/mother persona. [As to] How did I overcome it? Try, try, try again is the only way. After 3 failed marriages I finally feel that with my current husband I have gotten it right and couldn't be happier!" <br/>

                        <p style="padding:10px 50px">Discrimination is a major problem across the globe. For anyone who's been through it or is going through it, you should know that you're more than what they tell you and that this shouldn't limit you from what you can do and who you can be. <br/><br/>
                        Our first feature for this year's <strong>#WomenOfOA</strong> is our French CSR, <strong><a href="{{action('UserController@show',2625)}}" target="_blank" > Anais Andriatsivalaka</a></strong> . Anais is a native of Madagascar who has left home to pursue her career. She has moved to different countries in Africa, Europe, and now, Asia. In doing so, she has experienced the difficulties of being out of her comfort zone and being subjected to discrimination, sexism, and violence. With this experience, she shares a life lesson that may help people who's going through the same. "It is not easy just to leave home and be on your own especially when you are a woman moreover black: it may happen that you encounter discrimination, sexism and even violence. It is important not to take it personally and to remember that though it may be pure hatred, most of the time it is just linked to cultural gaps, and also a lack of knowledge and education." Along with her bubbly personality, Anais possesses the quality of a strong woman, and her wisdom attests to that. "Today, I feel grateful that I am still standing, able to discover other cultures, and bring all this experience to support my relatives and hopefully, as an asset to the company I join. [So,] should you decide to risk it (YES YOU SHOULD), do not to forget that wherever you go, no matter what people tell you or how much they try to put you down, you are here as a person and you have to fight— not against people but to try to be the best version of yourself because this is how you will stand out.” #WeSpeakYourLanguage #OAonWomensHistoryMonth<br/>

                           Top 5 activities that I enjoy, when I'm not wearing my hat 🎩 as Sr SEO Strategist for @openaccessbpo:<br/>

                            2. Running 🏃 (📸 @icanyoucanofficial)<br/>
                            3. Playing the #drums <br/>
                            4. Playing the 🎸 #guitar <br/>
                            5. Playing #football <br/>

                              Sharing my hobbies because January is apparently #HobbyMonth [tagged by @JAspacio]<br/>

                              1. #DRAWING. Been doing #pen and #ink #drawings since grade school and added some digital coloring during college. The ones I've managed to post here are tagged #DesksideDoodles.<br/>

                              2. #IMPROV. I've wanted to get into improv since high school, but only took the plunge last year.<br/>

                              3. GEOLOCATION GAMES. Playing location-based AR games like @PokemonGoApp and @Ingress Prime.<br/>

                              4. #PODCASTS. I listen to nearly 30 comedy, horror, geek-themed, and pop culture podcasts.<br/>

                              5. READING. Love sci-fi- and mystery-themed books and Filipino graphic novels. Sadly, I've been busy recently with my other hobbies, but I plan on denting my unread book pile this year.<br/>

                              6. SCULPTING. Another hobby that's been in the backburner for months now: molding things out of polymer clay. </p>

                              Sharing my hobbies because January is apparently #HobbyMonth [tagged by @JAspacio]<br/>

                              1. #DRAWING. Been doing #pen and #ink #drawings since grade school and added some digital coloring during college. The ones I've managed to post here are tagged #DesksideDoodles.<br/>

                              2. #IMPROV. I've wanted to get into improv since high school, but only took the plunge last year.<br/>

                              3. GEOLOCATION GAMES. Playing location-based AR games like @PokemonGoApp and @Ingress Prime.<br/>

                              4. #PODCASTS. I listen to nearly 30 comedy, horror, geek-themed, and pop culture podcasts.<br/>

                              5. READING. Love sci-fi- and mystery-themed books and Filipino graphic novels. Sadly, I've been busy recently with my other hobbies, but I plan on denting my unread book pile this year.<br/>

                              6. SCULPTING. Another hobby that's been in the backburner for months now: molding things out of polymer clay. </p>

                              Happy Hobby Month! 
                              I have three hobbies I usually spend my time off work on: photography, watercolor painting, and watching Chinese/Korean/Thai drama series. 
                              Among the three, photography brings me joy the most. It's where I also feel most at peace. </p>

The sign-up form has been sent out through Zimba already, and we are asking for your support to remind your respective teams to check out the email on Zimbra! For quick reference, here's the link: <br/><br/><a href="http://172.17.0.2/coffeebreak/event/5494/" target="_blank">http://172.17.0.2/coffeebreak/event/5494/</a><br/><br/>

                              The classes are free, and the employees may also use the shower rooms at the G2 office after each session. For those who will take the Yogalates class, the yoga mats will be provided.<br/><br/>

                              Employees may come before/after their shifts, during their break times, or rest days. However, should this coincide with their work schedule, they may approach any of the Workforce team ASAP to check if any work schedule changes may be accommodated.<br/><br/>

                              This week will be a test run and may be offered weekly, depending on the response this week.</p>

It is an international celebration of the importance of customer service and of the people who serve and support customers on a daily basis. It is commemorated annually during the first week of October. </p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px; font-size: smaller">This week, we are taking the time to Celebrate People. YOU. Our business is people. It's run by people. It's built for people. Its purpose is people. That's you and us behind our company, serving our clients and customers. All of us together making Open Access an awesome place to work in and be a part of.</p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px; font-size: smaller">As a company, all we do is help people. We help people have happy interactions. We deal with people who call, who chat, who message, who have back-office needs, and we try to resolve their issues and meet their business demands in the best way possible. That takes not just mental and physical energy, but also emotional energy, time, patience, and creativity. And it's a hard thing to try to make people happy all the time. So we're taking the time to recognize all your hard work and commitment this year.</p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px; font-size: smaller">Today is the day, this week is the week we celebrate you guys for working so hard at making our customers happy. We celebrate you. We celebrate us. </p>

                                <p style="padding-left: 20px; font-size: smaller">Watch out for the treats and surprises we have in store for all of you throughout the week.
                                To appreciate. To acknowledge. To highlight. To thank. To celebrate. Our most important asset: YOU. OUR PEOPLE.</p>

                     Ever heard of WACTEO? It stands for: <br/><strong>We Are Customers To Each Other</strong><br/><br/>

                      Most of us are aware of our external customers - it's worth noting that we have internal customers too - our colleagues.<br/><br/>

                      "When we talk and respond to fellow employees as we would to external customers, we help to change the culture of the organization to a customer centric one.  Every request between internal team members is one driven by a customer need and, thus, rather than being treated as a nuisance, the request should always be treated from a customer service perspective… it’s a shift in mindset to ‘I am responding to you as I would to an external customer’.” - Eva Nye<br/><br/>

                      Available for self enrolment for all employees until October 10 - Internal Customer Service Course. Composed of 8 modules with a total of 63 minutes seat time. <br/><br/>

                     How can you cultivate #inclusivity in a diverse workplace—or any workplace, for that matter? Listen, then learn.<br/><br/>

                      When we practice active open-mindedness, we can find common ground despite our differing cultures, languages, ages, races, genders and abilities. We learn to overcome the unconscious bias often deep-rooted in our values and transform these differences into strengths.<br/><br/>

                      We spend a third of our lives at work. So, let's work together to create better #workplace environments for all—until everyone feels recognized and accepted.<br/><br/>

                    Please be informed that our cut-off for December 10 payout is on Dec. 05, 2020. Employee's DTR should be approved and locked in EMS <strong class="text-danger"> on or before SUNDAY 12:00 noon of Dec. 06, 2020</strong>.<br/><br/>

                    In case that your rest day falls on the cut-off and has no access in EMS, please ensure to inform your immediate superior to lock your DTR on your behalf.

                    

                    Whether the DTR is locked or not, the Finance Department will assume the current data reflecting as final for salary computation and crediting.<br/><br/>

                  <strong>IMPORTANT REMINDERS:</strong><br/><br/>

                  All active employees as of December 15, 2020  who were hired on or before November 30, 2020 are eligible to receive the 13th month pay.<br/><br/>

                  In the event of separation from the company on or before December 15, 2020, the 13th month pay shall be included in the employee's last pay.<br/><br/>

                  The actual 13th month pay is computed where absences, tardiness, undertime and LWOP are deducted from your total earnings (basic pay + de minimis allowance) from January 10, 2020 payout to December 25, 2020 payout.  <br/><br/>


                  The 1/2 advanced 13th month pay of employees who opted to avail it in April 2020 will be deducted from their actual 13th month pay.<br/><br/> 





                  We will assume that your 13th month pay for December 25, 2020 payout will be paid in full. Any changes will be included for adjustment on January 10, 2021 payout.  Excess of 13th month pay from the Php 90,000.00 ceiling under Republic Act 10963 or TRAIN law will be subject to tax. <br/><br/>

                    Please be informed that our cut-off for DEC.23 payout is still on Dec.20, 2020. Due to early payout, we will  be having an early cut-off time for the approval and locking of DTRs. Employee's DTR should be approved and locked in EMS on or before <strong class="text-danger"> 10:00 am of December 21, 2020 (MONDAY).</strong>.<br/><br/>
                    All DTR  from EMS will be lifted on the said cut-off for the payroll computation purposes.<br/><br/>

                    In case that your rest day falls on the cut-off and has no access in EMS, please ensure to inform your immediate superior to lock your DTR on your behalf.

                   
                    Whether the DTR is locked or not, the Finance Department will assume the current data reflecting as final for salary computation and crediting.<br/><br/>

                    Please be guided accordingly.<br/><br/>

                    Being a single mom, with 3 kids and 3 dogs, facing the changes since ECQ was quite the predicament I had to quickly accept. I needed to deal with these while leading our team to enable our employees to work from home, develop and deploy a shuttle service system, set up office-dwelling, house a subset of our employees in temporary accommodations while ensuring we get our clients to agree with flexible work arrangements and caring for the health, safety, and livelihood of our employees.<br/><br/>

                    Dear Open Access Family,<br/><br/>

 

                      Since GCQ has been declared (May 16 for Davao and June 1 for Manila), know that we are taking a very prudent stance in transitioning back to our workplace. While the business dictates what programs go back in phases, we will be as careful as we need to be. Employee health and safety are paramount, hence the primary focus of our efforts and basis of our decisions will be to balance these with business needs.
                     <br/><br/>
                       

                      We take a guarded approach to continuing operations in Davao and G2 and reopening Jaka/6780.  While we will maintain part of our labor force working remotely and do so as long as we can, we are starting to proceed with the incremental increase of workers returning onsite.  Check with your program and department heads if and when your teams will be transitioning. We want everyone to be absolutely responsible and heedful while doing so.<br/><br/>

                       

                       

                      <strong class="text-primary"> Recap ECQ</strong><br/>

                      <strong>We have done all we can to ensure you were safe and productive during ECQ </strong><br/>

                      While many U.S. companies have needed to reduce their workforces or completely shut down, we are very fortunate many of our clients have remained stable and operational. This put us in a position to be able to support everyone and remaining operational, while on community quarantine. From deploying multiple company assets to enable you to work sheltered from your homes and allowing flexibility with work hours and leaves where needed, to providing free near-site and onsite accommodation, including provisions for free food, free roundtrip door-to-door transportation, as well as quarantine incentives; to adopting new corporate policies and procedures for health and safety, to communication blitzes for education on disease prevention.<br/><br/>

                       

                      <strong class="text-primary"> On to the New Normal: GCQ Onward</strong><br/>

                      <strong>Navigate through less restrictions and increased movement in GCQ with even more vigilance</strong><br/>

                      Let us not waste all the efforts in keeping our team safe and healthy over the last three months, by carelessly exposing ourselves to undue risk. Stay home if you’re working from there. Limit movement strictly to essentials as if your life and work depended on doing so.
                      <br/><br/>
                       

                      Let’s be grateful for all the company has done by committing to support our drive for personal accountability to protect our lives and our livelihood.  We need you to take responsibility for your own health and safety, be overly cautious and disciplined at all times, in and out of the office.<br/><br/>

                       

                      Please take time to read through our <a class="text-success" href="oampi-resources/item/67" target="_blank"><strong> transition strategy </strong></a> uploaded resource document. Thank you for your continued commitment.<br/><br/>

                       

                      In the meantime, be safe, team.  Be responsible. Be smart. Stay healthy<br/><br/>
                      All the best,<br/>

                    ATTENTION TO ALL:    <br/><br/>

                    We are reminding everyone to comply with our health and safety protocols such as the requirement to: <br/><br/>
                    Accomplish the Health Declaration Form prior to going to work.<strong class="text-primary">STAY HOME IF YOU ARE SICK. </strong> <br/><br/>
                    Wear a face mask and have your temperature taken prior to entering the office premises. <br/><br/>
                    Practice physical distancing and respiratory etiquette. <br/><br/>
                    The maximum penalty for non-compliance with the health and safety protocols is termination. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>

                    For guidance, we have outlined scenarios on how our health protocols will generally be implemented: <br/><br/>

                    <strong class="text-primary"> 1. Building Lobby</strong><br/>
                    If temperature is above 37.5C, you will no longer allowed by the building admin to proceed to the office. If necessary, the nurse will go to the lobby and confirm your temperature/assess before you sending home. <br/><br/>

                    <strong class="text-primary"> 2.  At the office reception prior to entering the production area</strong><br/>
                    Our guards will check your temperature. If above 37.5C or if you exhibit other symptoms, you will not be allowed to enter the office. The nurse will go to the reception area and assess before sending you home. <br/><br/>

                    <strong class="text-primary"> 3. During work</strong> <br/>
                    If you feel unwell during your shift, you are required to proceed to the  nearest designated area (isolation room or clinic) from your workstation. The nurse will  assess before sending you home.  <br/><br/>

                    <strong class="text-primary"> 4. Emergency Room Transport, if necessary after Nurse assessment.</strong><br/>
                    The nurse will explain and set expectations on the need for immediate ER transfer (nearest hospital is Makati Medical Center). You may notify a family member about the situation. No one can join in the elevator except for the nurse. Upon arrival in the ER, the nurse will properly endorse the patient to the hospital ER personnel. <br/><br/>
                    Thank you.

                    Please be informed that we will strictly implement the 24-hour rule in locking your DTR in EMS. This is for the Timekeeping team to regularly upload your approved change work schedule, DTRPs, leaves, and overtime from EMS to Jeonsoft for payroll computation purposes.<br/><br/>
                    <strong class="text-danger"> DTRs should be locked within 24 hours after your shift</strong>, except on the last working day of the cut-off which should be locked the following day on or before 12PM. The change work schedule, DTRPs, leaves, and overtime should be approved by the immediate head within the same date such filings were applied and filed. Once all the filings are approved and reflected, you may now lock your DTR.  We will then assume that your DTR is correct and reviewed by yourself.<br/><br/>

                    To reiterate our previous email reminders, it is imperative to observe the following:<br/><br/>


                    1. <strong class="text-danger"> NO LOITERING </strong>outside the office premises and building.<br/><br/>
                    2. <strong class="text-danger">NO SMOKING</strong> in non-designated areas.  <br/><br/>
                    3. <strong class="text-danger">AVOID going in and out</strong> of the office building.<br/><br/>
                     <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle text-orange"></i> Stay inside the lobby while waiting for the shuttle service.<br/><br/>
                    
                    <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle text-orange"></i> ALWAYS wear a mask inside the office premises, going to/from office, or while outside or in public places.<br/><br/>
                     <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle text-orange"></i> ALWAYS follow the physical distancing inside the office premises, outside the office, at shuttle service and public places.<br/><br/>
                     

                    In as much as BPO is one of the essential services that are open, it does not mean that we are at liberty of movement. During this ECQ period, movement of BPO employees are allowed only for the purpose of going to/from the office. .In order to address the Makati City Police PCP5 concerns on the volume of personnel loitering around Ayala Center, the G2 Building Admin will be issuing a limited number of passes to all BPO tenants.  For onsite employees, there will be an assigned Housekeeping Personnel with passes who can accommodate requests for emergency/urgent essential purchases within the office vicinity.  <br/><br/>

                     

                    The Ayala Center Estate Association (ACEA) will report all those who are found loitering, smoking or doing unnecessary activities within Ayala Center and the G2 Building Admin may prevent violators from returning to the G2 building until after the ECQ is lifted. Likewise, the City of Makati prohibits among others loitering in public places within the ECQ period.<br/><br/>

                    Further, attached is the Makati City Ordinance No. 2020-089, requiring the mandatory wearing of face masks and other similar protective equipment penalizing its violation thereof.<br/><br/>

                    Please be guided accordingly.

                     For workforce health and safety, it is critical that basic protective measures be taken at all times by our skeletal workforce, office dwellers, and temporary accommodation stayers.<br/></br/>


                      <strong class="text-primary"> Wash your hands frequently</strong></br/>
                      Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
                      Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.<br/></br/>

                      <strong class="text-primary"> Maintain social distancing</strong></br/>
                      Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
                      Why? When someone coughs or sneezes, they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.<br/></br/>

                      <strong class="text-primary"> Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth</strong></br/>
                      Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.<br/></br/>

                      <strong class="text-primary"> Practice respiratory hygiene</strong></br/>
                      Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
                      Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.<br/></br/>

                      <strong class="text-primary"> If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early</strong></br/>
                      Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
                      Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.

                    Please be informed that our cut-off for February 24, 2021, payout is on February 20, 2021. Due to early payout, we will be having an early cut-off  time for the approval and locking of DTRs. Employee's DTR should be approved and locked in EMS on or before <strong class="text-danger">SUNDAY 10:00 am of February 21, 2021.</strong> All DTR from EMS will be lifted on the said cut-off for the payroll computation purposes.  In case that your rest day falls on the cut-off and has no access in EMS, please ensure to inform your immediate supervisor to lock your DTR on your behalf.<br/><br/>

                    We encourage you to <strong class="text-danger"> lock your DTR regularly</strong> to ensure that you will be paid correctly and that any DTR problems or future disputes will be prevented. <br/><br/>

                    We are glad to announce that the company has arranged for ITR assistance to our employees who are NOT qualified for substituted filing.  An engagement with a third-party vendor has been done to make this possible.<br/><br/>

                    If you opt to avail of this service, please submit your BIR Form 2316 and other pertinent details (see attached flowchart) to employeeitr@openaccessbpo.com as a starting point for the computation of your annual income tax return.  The assistance of the third-party vendor is up to the filing of ITR only.  It is the responsibility of the employee to pay his income tax if he has tax payable.<br/><br/>

                    Please be informed that the assistance of our third-party vendor is until April 15, 2021.  You can send questions or clarifications up to that date only.<br/><br/>

                    Below is the summary of activities:<br/><br/>

                    1.  The employee will send the 2316 and other pertinent details to the third-party vendor (see attached flowchart).<br/><br/>
                    2.  Upon receipt of 2316, the third-party vendor will compute and send the income tax computation to the employee.<br/><br/>
                    3.  If the employee confirms and agrees to the computation, the third-party vendor will proceed to file the ITR (BIR Form 1700) via eBIRForms.  BIR will send a Confirmation Receipt once the filed ITR was received.  Afterwards, the third-party vendor will send the ITR (BIR Form 1700) and Confirmation Receipt to the employee. On the other hand, the employee should send an email to employeeitr@openaccessbpo.com if he does not want to proceed in availing the service of our third-party vendor.<br/><br/>
                    If with tax payable, the employee will print the ITR (BIR Form 1700) and its Confirmation Receipt and pay the corresponding amount to any payment accredited center (e.g. bank, GCash, etc.) on or before April 15, 2021.  End of process.<br/><br/>
                    If no tax payable, the third-party vendor will bring the printed ITR (BIR Form 1700)  to the BIR for stamping on or before April 15, 2021.  The finance department will distribute these hard copies (stamped BIR Form 1700) to employees.  Please wait for further communication.  End of process.<br/><br/>
                    4.  On the other hand, the employee should send an email to employeeitr@openaccessbpo.com if he does not want to proceed in availing the service of our third-party vendor.<br/><br/>

                    Before you enter the company shuttle, (along with your face mask and shield, and completing the HDF) be sure to bring your own pen for signing the official Passenger Log to confirm the start and completion of your ride. This is to limit the possible transmission of germs and viruses from shared pens. This is also in compliance with our HR Health and Safety Protocols. Starting March 5, our drivers will no longer lend pens to shuttlers.<br/><br/>

                    Not only is it polite to wait until you’re in a more private area before engaging in a call, but it also limits the spread of droplets in an enclosed space. This applies in public transport as well as in our company vehicles. Stay courteous as well as safe. Don’t make or receive phone calls while in our company vehicles.<br/><br/>
                      
                     <strong class="text-primary">5-MINUTE GRACE PERIOD   </strong><br/>
                    In keeping with courtesy, professionalism, and punctuality, please be in your designated pickup place early or on time (early is of course better).  As ours is a rideshare transport model, our drivers have trip queues and schedules they need to critically maintain. Do not wait for an SMS message as drivers are not obligated to send these because your official ride confirmation is sent via your Trip Notification Email. Your ride details are specified there and confirms both your home and office pickup. As a courtesy to your co-passengers and driver, please be prompt. Lateness is tracked and may negatively affect shuttler privilege status.<br/><br/>

                    Please do not cause delays, as these may negatively impact your and others' attendance status as well our trip queue and business operations.<br/><br/>

                    The OA Company Shuttle is a free transport service and passenger support process Open Access BPO has graciously provided for you, our onsite workers.  The transport service provider is a fleet of professional drivers outsourced by the company to meet your transport needs during this pandemic.  They deliver competent and licensed service and are answerable to the company, hence they are not to be treated as personal chauffeurs or Grab drivers. Please do your part by knowing and observing our policies and procedures, and respecting our drivers, your co-riders, and our process.<br/><br/>

                    For your compliance. Thank you.

They actively send away cars if they are caught waiting for several minutes, sometimes even less than 5 minutes. <br/><br/>



                    <strong class="text-primary">Less than 5 Minutes and Car Asked to Leave = Proceed to Landmark Palm Drive Parking Slot </strong><br/>
                    If traffic patrol directs the driver to leave the waiting area before the grace period is due, the driver will have to leave ADP but will wait for you for the remaining duration of the waiting period in the Landmark Parking Slot along Palm Drive cor West St. Please head there as soon as you can because when 5 minutes is up, the driver will have to leave for the next pickup.<br/><br/>


                    <strong class="text-primary">After 5 Minutes = Leave Without Warning: No Show</strong><br/>
                    To comply with this new zone procedure, we will more stringently keep to our 5-minute grace period prescribed in our transport guidelines, and no longer grant exceptions.  As stated in our policy, if you are not in the vehicle within 5 minutes, the driver may leave without warning and you will be penalized as a No Show and which will cause your shuttle privilege status to be red flagged.<br/><br/>


                    For your guidance. Thank you.

                    <strong>REMINDER TO ALL ONSITE EMPLOYEES:</strong><br/>
                    Effective March 01, 2021, please be advised that we will revert to our standard Dress Code policy.<br/><br/>
                    
                    <strong class="text-primary">Brief </strong><br/>This dress code policy defines how we as employees are expected to dress at work. We should be aware that our  appearance matters and contributes to shaping the overall image of the company. Besides our performance, our  appearance is included in representing our business to clients and other parties. We, therefore, should be mindful to  dress in a manner that is respectful of others and creates a positive impression and reflection of the Open Access  culture. <br/><br/>

                    <strong class="text-primary">Scope  </strong><br/><br/>
                    This policy applies to all our employees. <br/><br/><br/><br/>
                   
                    <strong class="text-primary">Casual Dress Code  </strong><br/><br/>
                    Our company’s official dress code is Casual. See the policy elements and guidelines below for what casual office  dressing comprises. For special events, we may prescribe employees to wear attire with varying degrees of formality  or style. An employee’s position and function may additionally inform their dress code. If they frequently meet with  clients or prospects, they should dress appropriately to represent Open Access BPO positively.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>

                    <strong class="text-primary">Policy Elements  </strong><br/><br/>
                    Enumerated below are specific parameters to help us understand and follow our dress code rules. These guidelines  will always apply: 
                    <br/><br/>

                    <strong>All employees must be clean and tidy.</strong> <br/><br/>
                    ● We as employees must maintain basic grooming and hygiene as these ensure personal and workplace safety and  sanitation. <br/><br/>
                    ● Dressing styles dictated by ethnicity and religion are not restricted. <br/><br/><br/><br/>

                    <strong>All clothes must project professionalism.</strong> <br/><br/>
                    ● Clothes not appropriate to a place of business are not allowed. <br/><br/>
                    ● Guidelines for what are considered unsuitable or indecorous: <br/><br/>

                    Clothing articles whose design and/or material overly expose skin, or the form of the body are prohibited. (e.g.: forearms, upper thighs, cleavage, lower back, navel, etc.) <br/><br/><br/><br/>

                    <strong>All clothes must be office appropriate.</strong> <br/><br/>
                    ● Clothing pieces containing profanity and offensive language are not allowed. <br/><br/>
                    ● Overly informal or form-fitting outfits and gym gear are not permitted, even on weekends.  
                     (e.g.: shorts, sleeveless jerseys, crop or open-back tops, cutout or mesh leggings, etc.) <br/><br/>
                    ● During bad weather, bring a change of clothes if you anticipate your commute to be particularly rough, then change  in the office. <br/><br/>

                    Examples of inadmissible office clothing:  <br/><br/>
                    slippers, flip flops, shorts, sleeveless tops, cropped tops. miniskirts, etc. <br/><br/>
                    All clothes must be well-kept and in *good condition. <br/><br/>

                    *Ripped jeans and other similar items (causing no undue skin exposure) are allowed for style expression, as long as  the overall look is still dressed up and office appropriate. 
                    <br/><br/>

                    <strong class="text-primary"> Disciplinary Consequences  </strong><br/>
                    Employees are required to respect and follow our dress code. When an employee disregards these dress code  regulations and guidelines, their immediate head must remind, reprimand or coach for behavior improvement, and  report for *appropriate disciplinary action. In some cases, management may ask employees to return home to  change.  <br/><br/>

                    Employees may face more severe consequences up to and including termination, if: <br/>
                    • Their appearance causes irreparable damage, like the loss of a business or client. <br/><br/>
                    • Violations are repeated. <br/><br/><br/><br/>

                    Nonadherence to this policy will result in disciplinary action which may lead up to termination: Schedule of Discipline - Office Protocol and Decorum Rule VIII Section 1  <br/><br/>
                    1st offense: Verbal Warning <br/><br/>
                    2nd offense: Written Warning <br/><br/>
                    3rd offense: Final Warning <br/><br/>
                    4th offense: Termination

Also, while the new pronouncement includes curfew hours for Metro Manila and some other cities, the BPO industry is exempted hence our business operations will not be affected.<br/><br/>

                       

                      The following measures and provisions remain in place as usual:<br/><br/>
                      <ul class="text-left">
                          <li>Policies, practices, and tools updated to manage and support our integrated workforce (at-home workers and skeletal onsite personnel)<br/></li>

                          <li>Amped interdepartmental coordination and regular employee communications<br/></li>

                          <li>Provisions and health/safety protocols maintained for onsite workers<br/></li><br/>

                          <li>Company transport*<br/></li>

                          <li>Office meals when establishments are closed<br/></li>

                          <li>Mandatory health declaration prior to riding company vehicles and entering office premises<br/></li>

                          <li>Physical distancing, protection, and disinfection protocols<br/></li>
                      </ul>
                        <br/><br/></p>

                       

                       

                      <p style="padding: 30px;" class="text-left"><em>* Our company shuttle service operates 24/7 as usual. There are no changes so far, unless otherwise announced by the government and Transport Department. We will maintain our current:<br/><br/>
